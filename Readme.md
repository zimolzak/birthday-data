Analyze Birthday Data
========================

Look at times and message content of happy birthday messages that were
posted to my Facebook timeline. My main conclusion is that **if it
doesn't start with the exact string "Happy", then it's likely to be a
long message** (P = 0.038). Also, you people are posting on Facebook
pretty early for an average weekday. Get back to work!
